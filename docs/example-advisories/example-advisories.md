# Example Advisories

The advisories in this folder help you to setup a small environment to test
the features of the ISDuBA application. You just need
[to import them](../setup.md#import-advisories) to your database.

## Example: Multiple Versions

If you want to create a diff of two documents to see how an advisory evolved
import both documents in the folder [multiple-versions](./multiple-versions).
